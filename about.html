<h1>About</h1>
<p>I'm Quena Soruco and I will attend the Craft Academy Bootcamp in about three weeks. 
    <br>It's a 12 week intense course that will teach me and 13 other people from different backgrounds to code. 
    <br>Somewhere within this time I will have acquired the knowledge on how to make a much better website than this one.
    <br>I will then have this website to look back to as a reference on where my HTML and CSS skills were when I began
    <br>and hopefully be able to make a much improved website by the end of the course.
